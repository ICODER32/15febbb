## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have installed the [Lighthouse Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en)

* It's done when I have navigated to `https://mini-project-lighthouse.herokuapp.com/` in a Chrome browser.

* It's done when I have used the Lighthouse Chrome extension to generate an audit report.

* It's done when I have selected `Expand View` and have clicked on the link to each key metric and reviewed the provided information.

* It's done when I have reviewed the key PWA optimizations.

* It's done when I have noted the performance metrics and PWA optimizations in the [audit.md](./Unsolved/audit.md) file.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we run Lighthouse through the command line or install as a node module?
