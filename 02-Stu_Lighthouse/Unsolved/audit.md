# Lighthouse Audit

Make note of the performance metrics and PWA optimizations generated by the Lighthouse report. It's important to remember that metrics can vary greatly between operating systems, so don't worry if your results are different from your peers or instructor.

## PWA optimizations

Scroll down the audit report until you see the `PWA` section that lists the PWA optimizations. Make note of the various aspects of a PWA below (the first one is done for you):

- Configured for a custom splash screen
- Sets a theme color for the address bar.
- Content is sized correctly for the viewport
- Has a <meta name="viewport"> tag with width or initial-scale
