# üìê Add Comments to Implementation of IndexedDB

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in the [database.js](./Unsolved/src/js/database.js) file.

1. In the command line, navigate to `22-Stu_IndexedDB/Unsolved`.

2. Run `npm install`.

3. To launch the application, run `npm run start`.

4. Open the `index.html` file in the browser from the  `dist` directory.

5. To view the IndexedDB store, visit the `Application` tab in Chrome DevTools.

Refer to the documentation:

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:
