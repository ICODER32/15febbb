# üìñ Implement Caching for CSS and JS Files

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to cache the CSS and JS files so that I don't have to download them every time I load a page.

* As a developer, I want to implement workbox caching strategies so that I can improve the performance of the app.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I have imported `injectManifest` using destructuring assignment from the `workbox-webpack-plugin` inside the `webpack.config.js` file.

* It is done when I have registered a new Workbox service worker inside the `src/index.js` file using the `Workbox` constructor.

* It is done when I have added a new `InjectManifest` plugin to the `plugins` array in `webpack.config.js`.

* It is done when I have specified the `swSrc` and `swDest` properties in the `InjectManifest` constructor in the `plugins` array in `webpack.config.js`.

* It is done when I have registered a route for the caching of static assets (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS) by using a `staleWhileRevalidate` strategy for files that aren't pre-cached, by matching against the destination of the incoming request. This is done in the `src/sw.js` file.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [Google docs on common recipes](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/common-recipes)

## üí° Hints

* What does the `staleWhileRevalidate` strategy do? Is there another strategy that could be used?

* What are some different methods of matching files that we want to cache? How can we use the `destination` property on the `request` object to our advantage?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the difference between `GenerateSW` and `InjectManifest`?
