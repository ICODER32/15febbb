# 🐛 The Delete Button Does Not Remove the List Item When Clicked

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* As a user, I want to be able to delete a list item from a list when I click on the list item.

* As a user, I want to be able to edit a list item when I click the Edit button.

## Expected Behavior

When a user clicks on an item, it is removed from the list of tasks.

When a user clicks on the Edit button, a text input is displayed with the list item to be edited. After pressing the Enter key, the list item is updated accordingly.
